# DOTFILES

Personal collection of various config files.
GNU `stow` is used to create a final configuration combining those various pieces.

To install the configuration for a particular application, use the `install.sh` script:

```sh
./install.sh <folder>
```

This will run bootstrap scripts as needed.
